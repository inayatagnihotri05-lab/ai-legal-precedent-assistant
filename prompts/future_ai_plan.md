# Future AI Integration Plan

This document outlines the future plan for integrating AI into the Legal Precedent Analysis Prototype.

---

## 1. Objectives

- Automatically analyze case facts and identify relevant legal issues
- Retrieve similar past judgments from a large corpus of cases
- Suggest structured arguments for small, low-stakes disputes
- Support court preparation and legal research

---

## 2. Proposed Modules

1. **AI Case Analyzer**  
   - Inputs: Structured case JSON  
   - Outputs: Highlighted legal issues, relevant laws, and risk assessment  

2. **AI Precedent Retriever**  
   - Inputs: Legal issues and context  
   - Outputs: Ranked list of past similar cases with summaries  

3. **AI Hearing Simulator**  
   - Inputs: Case facts and precedent summaries  
   - Outputs: Non-binding argument suggestions and structured hearing outline  

---

## 3. Safety & Transparency

- All AI outputs will be **advisory only**  
- System will clearly indicate **non-binding recommendations**  
- Human review remains **mandatory** for all decisions

---

## 4. Notes

- No AI is currently integrated  
- This plan is intended for **future development and research purposes** only  
- Ensures the system remains **fully court-safe** for current demos
