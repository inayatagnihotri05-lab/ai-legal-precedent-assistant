# Demo: AI-Assisted Legal Precedent Analysis

This document demonstrates how to run the AI-Assisted Legal Precedent Analysis prototype.

---

## 1. Overview

The system:
- Loads a structured small-case file (`sample_small_case.json`)
- Identifies legal issues (rule-based)
- Generates case context
- Shows example relevant precedents (non-AI, placeholder)

All outputs are **advisory and non-binding**.

## 2. Running the Demo

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Open a terminal in the repository root.
3. Run the backend app:

```bash
python backend/app.py
